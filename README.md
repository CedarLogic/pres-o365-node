Demos
-----
- **[officeaddin-outlook - Office Add-in for Outlook using Node.js & Angular](officeaddin-outlook)**

	This sample demonstrates how to create an Office Add-in for Outlook using non-Microsoft technologies. Office Add-ins are web applications that are referenced by the hosting Office client application. In this sample the web application is implemented as an [Angular 1.3.x](http://angularjs.org) application with two views that calls a server side WebAPI implemented [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org). All JavaScript in this sample is written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org). 

- **[node-o365-web - Node.js Website with AzureAD & Office 365 Integration](node-o365-web)**

	This sample demonstrates how to create a website using [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) that authenticates with AzureAD & Office 365 using REST APIs. In this sample the website is bare-bones... implemented as an MVC style site using Handlebars as the view engine. All JavaScript in this sample is written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).
